title: Enhancing LLM Tutoring Through Prompt Design
---

This project explores how structured prompting influences the behavior and communication style of large language models (LLMs) in tutoring contexts. The task involves conducting two tutoring sessions on the same topic—one with no structured prompt (a “vanilla” LLM session) and one using the Mollick structured tutoring prompt—to compare how prompt design affects engagement, adaptability, and instructional quality. By analyzing differences in tone, responsiveness, and teaching effectiveness, this project aims to evaluate how well LLMs can emulate effective tutoring communication and identify potential improvements through prompt modification.
