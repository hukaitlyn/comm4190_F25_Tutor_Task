    "> We’ll start with:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * The **basic rules** of touch rugby (how play starts, how to score, what “six touches” means).\n",
    "> * **Field layout** and positions (middles, links, and wings).\n",
    "> * **Ball-handling fundamentals:** how to pass backward, catch cleanly, and maintain flow.\n",
    "> * Simple footwork drills for movement and agility.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### ⚙️ **Stage 2: Team Play & Strategy**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Next, we’ll cover:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Attacking patterns:** quick rolls, switches, wraps, and sweeps.\n",
    "> * **Defensive structure:** maintaining a flat line, communication, and reading play.\n",
    "> * Transition drills to improve reaction speed and awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 💪 **Stage 3: Game Awareness & Fitness**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Once you’re confident with the basics:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Decision-making under pressure — when to pass, when to run, and when to reset.\n",
    "> * **Set plays and ruck speed.**\n",
    "> * Conditioning routines specific to touch rugby (short sprints, lateral movement, endurance).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### 🎯 **Stage 4: Improving Your Game**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We’ll focus on:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Common mistakes and how to fix them.\n",
    "> * Position-specific tips (e.g., how wings can exploit space or how middles control defense).\n",
    "> * Video analysis (I can walk you through plays if you share clips).\n",
    "> * Match mindset and teamwork communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Before we start **Lesson 1**, can you tell me:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1. Your **current experience level** — have you played before, or are you completely new?\n",
    "> 2. Do you want to focus more on **casual play**, **competitive club-level**, or **school/university-level** touch rugby?\n",
    "> 3. Do you have access to a **team or training space**, or will you mostly be practicing solo?\n",
